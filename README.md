# Projects
 I have created an e-commerce site example using .NET Core and MVC, which includes libraries like Fluent Validation and AutoMapper. The site has an admin panel, user registration, email-based registration approval, and data retrieval from MS-SQL Server.
 
 You can access the admin panel login page by typing /admin in the site's search bar.
