Projects
I created an e-commerce site sample using .NET Core and MVC, including libraries such as Fluent Validation and AutoMapper. The site has an admin panel, user registration, email-based registration approval, and the ability to retrieve data from MS-SQL Server.
You can access the admin panel login page by typing /admin in the site's search bar.
It also communicates with the web service I created using Onion Architecture and CQRS to retrieve some data.
